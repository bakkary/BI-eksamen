## Problem formulation

based on the data that we have available we want to explore the eligibility of each city to join the c40 initiative and what are the main factors that make a city eligible to join the initiative.

we want to base the assessment on the members of the initiative and then explore the likelihood of the other cities to join the initiative.

we want to do this by using the random forest algorithm to predict the likelihood of a city to join the initiative based on the data that we have available.

since we dont have multiple measurements on each city in our dataset we want to compare the cities to the members of the initiative and then use the random forest algorithm to predict the likelihood of the other cities to join the initiative.

our project should be able to answer the following questions:

- what are the main factors that make a city eligible to join the c40 initiative?

- what is the likelihood of a city to join the c40 initiative based on the data that we have available?


the category of users who could benefit from our project are:

- city officials who want to join the initiative and want to know the likelihood of their city to join the initiative.

- researchers who want to explore the main factors that make a city eligible to join the initiative.

- the c40 initiative who want to know the likelihood of a city to join the initiative based on the data that we have available.
