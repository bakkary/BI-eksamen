**Problem Formulation**

Based on the available data, our objective is to assess the eligibility of each city to join the C40 initiative and identify the key factors influencing a city's eligibility for participation.

Our approach involves analyzing the existing members of the initiative, represented by c40 countries, to establish criteria for eligibility. The remaining countries will serve as the training dataset for the machine learning model, utilizing the random forest algorithm.

To achieve this, we plan to employ the random forest algorithm to predict the probability of a city joining the initiative, utilizing the data at our disposal. Given the limited measurements for each city in our dataset, our methodology involves comparing cities to current initiative members (c40 countries) and leveraging the random forest algorithm to predict the likelihood of other cities joining the initiative.

The primary questions our project aims to answer include:

1. What are the main factors determining a city's eligibility to join the C40 initiative?
2. What is the likelihood of a city joining the C40 initiative based on the available data?

The potential user categories benefiting from our project encompass:

- City officials seeking information on the likelihood of their city joining the initiative.
- Researchers interested in exploring the primary factors influencing a city's eligibility for C40 initiative membership.
- The C40 initiative itself, looking to understand the likelihood of a city joining based on the available data.
