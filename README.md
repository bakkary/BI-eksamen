Project Overview:  
The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) aims to foster sustainable urban development and robust climate action globally. Identifying cities eligible for C40 membership and understanding the myriad factors influencing such eligibility are crucial for the initiative's strategic planning and expansion. This project leverages data analysis and advanced machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cities joining the C40 initiative, thus supporting its mission.  

Problem Statement:  
As the C40 initiative continues to expand its global impact on sustainable urban development and climate action, pinpointing and engaging eligible cities becomes increasingly important. Our project seeks to analyze various socio-economic, environmental, and policy-related factors to predict a city's eligibility for C40 membership. These predictions aim to aid the initiative's strategic planning and expansion efforts.  
  
Solution:  
We propose a predictive model developed through advanced machine learning techniques to estimate cities' eligibility for C40 membership based on diverse criteria. The insights derived from this model are intended to assist in the strategic planning and decision-making processes for the C40 initiative, thereby facilitating its growth and impact.  
  
Motivation:  
Driven by a deep concern for the implications of climate change and the potential of technological innovations to combat these challenges, we are motivated to apply our data analysis and machine learning expertise towards promoting global sustainable development through the C40 initiative. This project not only allows us to harness technology for social good but also offers a unique opportunity for personal and professional growth in pursuit of a more sustainable future.  
  
Methodology:  
Our choice of methodology was guided by the classification nature of determining a city's eligibility for the C40 initiative. We selected the Random Forest algorithm for its efficacy in classification tasks and supplemented our approach with linear regression analysis to uncover relationships within our dataset. To ensure the predictive model's accuracy and reliability, crucial for strategic planning, we employed hyperparameter tuning to refine the model's performance.  
  
Theoretical Foundation:  
This study is anchored in the principles of sustainable development and climate change mitigation. By harnessing advanced machine learning techniques to predict cities' eligibility for C40 membership, we aim to contribute meaningful insights towards formulating effective strategies and policies for sustainable urban development and climate protection. Our analysis offers valuable perspectives for strategic decision-making in these critical areas.
